### Hi there 👋

📍 Thanks for visiting my Github! My name is Anes and I am a qualified data engineer with experience in delivering analytical projects.

🌱 I am working on new data projects (see here for portfolio) to expand my technical skillset and build practical and innovative software. I would love to collaborate so please do reach out with any opportunities!

💻 I recently graduated from the Northcoders Data Engineering bootcamp where I became proficient using Python, SQL and Cloud (AWS) to develop end-to-end data pipelines.
